Data Science Project Template
==============================

Minimal template repository for Data Science Projects.

__Instructions:__
- Fork this repo.
- Replace this section and the title with something relevant for your project.
- Rename the `src` directory to the name you wish to give to this project's python package 
- Run a "search and replace all" over the entire project from `src` to the python package name chosen (make sure setup.py was updated).

# Installation

## Python Dependencies

To install the project Python Package, you should have Python 3.10 installed as well as the packages specified in `environment.yml`. 
A quick and easy way to prepare this setup is by using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):
```commandline
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage
### Running the data processing pipeline
```commandline
python -m src.data.make_dataset
```
